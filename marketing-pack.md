## Funnel Architecture

### Awareness → Activation → Revenue

```

### Key Metrics Per Stage

| Stage | Metric | Target |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Awareness | Monthly unique visitors | 10,000 |
| Acquisition | Free tier signups / month | 500 |
| Activation | Users completing first snapshot | 60% of signups |
| Revenue | Free → Pro conversion | 8-12% |
| Retention | Monthly active (2+ snapshots) | 40% |

### Free Tier Strategy
The free tier is the product's moat. It delivers genuine value (Search + Debug + Skills = 13 generators) so users experience the output quality before paying. The free outputs include AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md — files that make their AI tools immediately better. This creates a reference point: "If the free tier does this, what does Pro unlock?"
