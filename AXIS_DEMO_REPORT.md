## Self-Referential Observations

This is the third complete Axis' Iliad demo:
1. **Payment Engine** — 18 programs, 30 files (external project)
2. **Avatar Foundry** — 18 programs, 25 files (AI project)
3. **Axis' Iliad** — 18 programs, 25 files (self-referential)

The self-referential demo proves:
- The system can analyze its own architecture and produce accurate outputs
- 86 generators described in axis_all_tools.yaml are real and produce real artifacts
- The midnight_command design system is consistent across all visual outputs
- YAML governance data is correctly surfaced in context maps, debug playbooks, and agent instructions
- The determinism claim is demonstrated: every artifact is derived from the same snapshot data

**Axis' Iliad analyzing itself is the strongest possible proof that the system works.**
