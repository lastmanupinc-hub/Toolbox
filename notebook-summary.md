## Research Threads

### Thread 1: YAML Governance Architecture
**Question**: How do 12 YAML files create a self-governing AI system?

**Findings**:
- The 12 YAML files form a constitutional hierarchy: `begin.yaml` gates session entry (8 conditions), `continuation.yaml` maintains live state (ground truth), `axis_all_tools.yaml` defines canonical program specs (supersedes all other sources), `automated_remedial_action.yaml` runs self-audit loops
- Governance is not advisory — it's enforced by the execution model. The session cannot proceed without clearing begin.yaml gates. Capabilities cannot be promoted without evidence matching `capability_inventory.yaml` criteria
- `hygiene_and_memory.yaml` routes behavior through 4 phases: hygiene arbitration → canonical reassertion → memory implementation → state update
- Self-audit termination condition: `focus_scores ≤ 35` across all categories
- This pattern is novel: no other open-source project uses YAML as a constitutional control layer for AI behavior

**Open Questions**: How does the governance scale with additional programs beyond 17? What happens when YAML files conflict (e.g., begin.yaml gates vs. continuation.yaml state)?

---

### Thread 2: Deterministic Generation
**Question**: How does generator-core guarantee byte-identical output?

**Findings**:
- 6 dedicated determinism tests verify that the same input produces identical output bytes
- Generators are pure functions: `(snapshot: Snapshot, config: GeneratorConfig) => string`
- No randomness, no timestamps in output (unless explicitly part of the generator contract)
- Template engine is custom-built — no Handlebars/EJS/Mustache dependency
- Output format is determined by program spec in axis_all_tools.yaml (markdown, JSON, YAML, TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS)
- Determinism enables CI validation: if a generator changes output, tests catch it immediately

**Open Questions**: How are edge cases handled (e.g., OS-specific line endings, locale-dependent sorting)? What's the performance profile for large repos with 1000+ files?

---

### Thread 3: Zero-Dependency HTTP Router
**Question**: Why build a custom HTTP server instead of using Express/Fastify?

**Findings**:
- Core invariant: "Zero external runtime HTTP dependencies"
- The router uses Node.js native `http.createServer()` with a custom routing table
- Pattern matching for routes, middleware chain for auth/rate-limiting/CORS
- 75+ endpoints across: snapshots CRUD, projects, accounts, billing, webhooks, generated files, health, metrics
- Rate limiting: 60 req/min standard, 120 req/min for auth endpoints
- Prometheus metrics endpoint for observability
- OpenAPI 3.1 spec generated from route definitions
- Benefit: zero supply chain risk from HTTP framework vulnerabilities (no Express CVEs apply)

**Open Questions**: What's the performance baseline vs. Fastify for equivalent route count? How is WebSocket support planned (for live generation progress)?

---

### Thread 4: Snapshot Pipeline Architecture
**Question**: How does a repo go from upload to 80 generated artifacts?

**Findings**:
- **5 input methods**: ZIP upload, GitHub URL, local directory (CLI), API POST, webhook trigger
- **Pipeline**: Input → Validation → Extraction → repo-parser (language/framework detection) → context-engine (context map + repo profile) → generator-core (80 generators) → Output (individual files or ZIP export)
- **Storage**: SQLite WAL mode, 5 tables: snapshots, projects, accounts, billings, webhooks
- **Billing**: Per-program SKU. Free tier: Search + Skills + Debug (13 generators). Pro: all 80
- **Output contract**: Each generator produces a specific file at a specific path with a specific format
- The pipeline is synchronous per snapshot — no job queue. This is a design choice, not a limitation (keeps complexity low)

**Open Questions**: What's the processing time distribution for repos of different sizes? Is there a cache layer for repeated analysis of the same repo at the same commit?

---

### Thread 5: Testing Strategy (2,910 Tests)
**Question**: How is 91.5% coverage achieved and maintained?

**Findings**:
- Framework: Vitest 4.1 (not Jest — faster, ESM-native)
- 101 test files across all packages and apps
- Test types: unit (generators, parsers, detectors), integration (API endpoints, full pipeline), determinism (byte-identical output), snapshot tests (expected output comparison)
- CI matrix: Node 20 + Node 22, ensuring forward compatibility
- Coverage enforcement: statement coverage tracked, likely with threshold in vitest config
- 6 determinism tests are a unique innovation — most projects don't test for output stability

**Open Questions**: What's the test execution time? Are there flaky tests? Is there mutation testing?

---

### Thread 6: Monorepo Package Architecture
**Question**: How do the 4 packages + 3 apps interact?

**Findings**:
- **Dependency flow** (strictly one-directional):
  ```
  apps/api → packages/snapshots + packages/context-engine + packages/generator-core
  apps/cli → packages/repo-parser + packages/context-engine + packages/generator-core
  apps/web → (API client only, no direct package imports)
  packages/generator-core → packages/context-engine (for context data types)
  packages/context-engine → packages/repo-parser (for detection results)
  packages/snapshots → (standalone, no package deps)
  packages/repo-parser → (standalone, no package deps)
  ```
- pnpm workspaces for package management
- TypeScript project references for build order
- Each package has its own tsconfig.json, test suite, and export boundary
- No circular dependencies (invariant #6 in the system)

**Open Questions**: Is there a shared types package, or are types duplicated? How are package versions managed (independent or lockstep)?
